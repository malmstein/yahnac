            "                  <span class=\"c00\">A couple of comments.  Sorry you were let go, but that is just business, they need people with more experience and likely learned the hard way that they can&#x27;t pay lower prices for less experience and expect things to work out.  That really isn&#x27;t a reflection on you or your abilities so much as it is on them for bad planning.  So don&#x27;t look at this as you failed them as much as they failed you and likely others.<p>As for what you do next.  Take a few days and chill and have some fun, spend a little time brushing up your resume and start sending them out.  There are a lot of positions available.  Remember this, when you are applying for jobs you are selling yourself and what you can do for the company.  So many times I interview developers and they don&#x27;t realize that they need to sell themselves.  I am not talking about being a sleazy used car salesman, but recognizing you have to tell people what you are capable of and be able to back it up with mastery of some set of skills.<p>Last point, you mentioned you are to early to have specialized.  I totally disagree with this approach but others may have different opinions.  I think you should specialize in a couple of key areas, generally for someone with 1-2 years experience I expect them to know a single language quite well, have a little knowledge of others and be able to do some data queries in SQL (or the database they have been using) etc.  I want new hires to have some depth not as much breadth, it is important to get a wide span of knowledge, but it is even more important to go deep in a couple of areas.  You have plenty of time to master multiple skills, but focus first as it makes you more valuable.  For a web dev, I&#x27;d expect decent JS, css, and whatever their front end language is to be fairly mastered in terms of syntax and core coding.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect advanced topics like concurrency or nuances of debugging yet (unless they have been heavily mentored).<p>Good luck, you should have plenty of runway depending on where you are at in the country, and whether you are willing to relocate.<span>\n" +

            "                  <span class=\"c00\">Thanks for the thought-out response. I think it&#x27;s typical among developers to think that their work stands for itself, so they don&#x27;t have to sell themselves. I agree with your statement that selling yourself is important. I recently beefed-up my resume[1] because I kinda saw this coming.<p>Interesting point on specialization. I&#x27;m not quite sure where I want to specialize, though. I love functional programming (Clojure et al) but Ruby and Python are fun too. I started in front-end years ago (high school?), so I&#x27;m extremely fluent in HTML, JS, CSS, but I&#x27;ve been getting more interested in algorithms, machine learning, and related stuff in recent months&#x2F;years.<p>I&#x27;ve got a few books from the library on programming that I plan to read, I think this will help me decide which direction to specialize in. Next I&#x27;ll decide on a project to establish my specialization. The books are: The Joy of Clojure, Functional Programming Patterns in Scala and Clojure, Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, and Web Development with Clojure. I also want to read The Rails Way (or something similar, since I don&#x27;t have formal training in Rails) and a book on algorithms.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1OrBr3KPDjeJBcXdKFJ2vE3tgAKQxThciGMsIX1icVx8&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1OrBr3KPDjeJBcXdKFJ2vE3tg...</a><span>\n" +

            "                  <span class=\"c00\">There&#x27;s a very salient point here that &quot;full stack&quot; development isn&#x27;t something you can start out doing. If you advertised yourself as a full stack developer with only a single year of professional development experience behind you, it&#x27;s likely that you were let go precisely because you aren&#x27;t a full stack developer. It takes years to develop the body of experience needed to truly work effectively as a &quot;full stack&quot; developer. Now, as mentioned by the insightful parent of this comment, that is more a reflection on the poor planning of the company (and lack of due diligence on their part) than on you, assuming you were forthright in your resume and interview about your history.<span>\n" +

It&#x27;s a small company, two backend devs (including me) and a frontend dev, though they are hiring 2 more backend devs. For a few weeks, I was the <i>only</i> backend dev. This means I touched all areas of the codebase: designed front-end functionality and aesthetic stuff, wrote backend services, setup devops workflows and did database stuff. So that&#x27;s why I used the term &quot;full-stack&quot;.<p>That said, I definitely plan on specializing over the next few weeks. Full-stack is hard! :)<span>\n" +

In order to emulate native apps, of course.<p>If we&#x27;re doing unpopular opinion time, I think this is the real issue that no one wants to talk about. I&#x27;m all for whatever feature development the community can standardize. Apple, google, mozilla, and etc. all have smart people working for them and when they cooperate things seem to work out fine. The problem is trying to achieve the feel of native applications in a _non_ native application. Browsers should do one thing well, but that one thing has no real business being duplication of mathematica, quake, or visual studio.<p>It&#x27;s always interesting to see a Show HN where someone cleverly gets an approximation of one or another of those things running in the browser, but come on. Making the browser the operating system is simply going to push the same old incompatibility problems into the browser. It&#x27;s not going to solve them.<span>\n" +

It&#x27;s the same reason that desktop Java was in vogue for a little while: you only have to write one UI, and you can run it from a HTTP connection with almost no local permissions. Of course, this was (and still is) a security nightmare, but browsers now do a pretty good job of sandboxing individual code blobs, and also do a pretty good job of abstracting away the native UI. Web apps also provide low or zero installation overhead (low friction to getting a user onboarded&#x2F;working&#x2F;monetized&#x2F;whatever).<p>It would be nice to see some progressive enhancement folks address how to resolve these pain points on the native side, rather than just saying web shouldn&#x27;t be like native.<span>\n" +
